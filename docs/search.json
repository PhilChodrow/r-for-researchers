    "text": "1.2 Install the Tidyverse\nWe’re actually going to be using a very specific set of packages for R, which are often collectively called the Tidyverse. To install the Tidyverse, first open RStudio. You’ll be greeted by a window that looks a bit like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The panels of the RStudio IDE. In this image, the console is the panel at the bottom left. Image credit: Anastasia Ushakova and Milan Valasek.\n\n\n\n\nLocate the console. When you first open RStudio, the console will typically contain some information about your R installation. If you click the console area, you should see a blinking cursor beside a >. In Figure 1.1, this is in the very bottom left of the image. This is the first and simplest way to interact with R.\nType the following command in the console, exactly as written.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nThen, hit Enter. You’ll see a series of messages flash across the console.\nThe installation might take a while. Once you see messages stop flashing, check the console output to see if there are any obvious error messages (usually highlighted in red).\nTo test your installation, paste the following code into your console, and hit enter. You’ll likely see some output as the tidyverse library is loaded (made ready to use). The last thing you see, however, should be the output below.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\"I installed all the software I need!\" %>% print()\n\n[1] \"I installed all the software I need!\"\n\n\nIf so, you are good to go!\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, you specifically."

You want the Free version of RStudio Desktop that corresponds to your computer’s operating system.\nDownload the Quarto Command Line Interface (CLI) that corresponds to your computer’s operating system."
